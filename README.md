# Risk Analysis for Loan Applications

## Project Overview
This project analyzes loan application data to identify risk factors, trends, and actionable insights for risk management. Using Python, the data was cleaned, visualized, and analyzed to classify loans into Low, Medium, and High Risk categories. The project also provides recommendations for minimizing default rates and improving loan portfolio management.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, converted categorical data, and added derived columns like `Risk Score`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized data trends and patterns using bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identified key factors affecting loan risk, such as loan amount and loan-to-income ratios.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provided recommendations for better loan assessment and risk mitigation.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Dataset**: Cleaned loan application data
